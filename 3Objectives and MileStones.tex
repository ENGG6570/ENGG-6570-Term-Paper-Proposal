\section{Objectives and Milestones}
\subsection{List of Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Experience both Gradle and Maven
    \item Compare the different features provided by Gradle and Maven
    \item Compare the efficiency between Gradle and Maven when building an Android Project
    \item Do the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis for both Gradle and Maven, and find out which one is better.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{The Milestones}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop an Android App with Android Studio + Gradle, then write the same Android app with Eclipse + Maven to get familiar with Maven
    \item Based on the experience in (1), write 2 pages report to discuss the different features provided by Maven and Gradle (I have registered for the "Introduction to Gradle Build Tool" workshop \url{https://gradle.com/training/introduction-to-gradle-july/?time=1626739200} on July 20-21 from Gradle's website so that I can have a better understanding about different features provided by Gradle )
    \item Learn how to "build cache" for both Maven and Gradle, and compare the efficiency between Gradle and Maven. (I have also registered for the "Introduction to Developer Productivity Engineering" workshop \url{https://gradle.com/training/dpe-workshop/?time=1623628800} on June 14 so that I can understand how exactly Gradle and Maven are handling the building ache task).
    \item Finish this article by analysing the difference in design pattern between Maven and Gradle, and make a conclusion which build tool has better future.
\end{enumerate}
