\section{Brute-force Method}
Theoretically, we can solve this problem and find the best solution with the Brute-force method. The time complexity will be bound by $O(M^K)$, Same as the famous traveling sales person (TSP) problem, this is also a NP-complete problem.
\subsection{Entropy of this problem}
\\ According to Shannon's information theory\cite{Shannon1948}, for a random variable $X$ in a finite set $\chi$ with probability distribution $p(x)$ , the  Shannon's entropy can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    H\left( X \right) =  - \sum\limits_{x \in \chi } {p\left( x \right){{\log }_2}\left( {p\left( x \right)} \right)}\label{shannon}
\end{equation}
For each of the robots, it will have at most M choice to choose the target. The total number of possible of arrangement is at most $M^K$. With considering the boundary condition that each of these M target need to have at least one robot, we can reduce the total number of possible of arrangement, $\chi$, as: 

\begin{equation}
\chi  = \underbrace {M\left( {M - 1} \right)\left( {M - 2} \right) \ldots 1}_{M!} \times C_{K - M}^K{M^{K - M}} = M!\frac{{K!}}{{\left( {K - K + M} \right)!\left( {K - M} \right)!}}{M^{K - M}} = \frac{{K!}}{{\left( {K - M} \right)!}}{M^{K - M}}
\end{equation}
