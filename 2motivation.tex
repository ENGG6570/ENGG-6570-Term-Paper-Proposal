\section{Model and Problem Statement}
Assume there are K homogeneous robots and M targets randomly distributed in a bounded 2D space. Each target requires at least one robot, and all the robots need to be assigned to a target. The cost is defined as the summation of the traveling path length over all the robots to their targets respectively. The goal is to develop a algorithm to find a traveling path for all the robots with the minimal or near minimal cost.
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1D model of K robots and M Targets
    \item 2D model of K robots and M Targets
    \item KD model of K robots and M targets
\end{itemize}
