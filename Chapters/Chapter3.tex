\chapter{The Proposed Approach to the Problem}
In this section, you should briefly outline your work for this problem: what do you
plan to do in your project? What results may you expect to have? You don't need to
give any details of your approach in your proposal, just list the ideas you plan to use to
solve the problems. Of course, if you know some details, you can put them here, e.g.,
your preliminary results. When you write your interim report, you should provide the
details of your proposed approach.
