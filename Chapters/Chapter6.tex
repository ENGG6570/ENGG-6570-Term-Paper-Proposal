\chapter{Summary}
To summarise, we have reviewed the historical origin of self organizing map as well as the significance of solving (or at least providing a near optimal solution) the NP-complete task scheduling problem. 
\\
Then, based on Anmin's two research paper about 1) the neural network approach for dynamic task assignment of multi-robots system and 2) SOM-based multi-agent architecture for the multi-robot system, we investigated the possibility of using SOM to solve the NP-Complete task scheduling problem. We conclude that the advantage of using SOM approach to solve task scheduling problem is that it is more time efficient than the brute force approach for large scale problem, and it can address the situation with moving targets while the other conventional approach are limited with static target assumption.
\\We are also going to provide a statistic method a quantities the efficiency and accuracy of the SOM approach, and try to improve SOM algorithm based on genetic algorithms.
